1. Deep Learning for Stock Market Prediction, M. Nabipour, 2020 [(link)](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/22/8/840) <br>

Predicts stock price for 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 days in the future.<br>
Uses decision tree, bagging, random forest, adaptive boosting (Adaboost), gradient boosting, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and artificial neural networks (ANN), recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM).

1. Stock Closing Price Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques, Mehar Vijh [(read it here)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050920307924) <br>
This work is pretty useless. It uses the highest - the lowest prices of the day's stock price it predicts. 
   It also uses the moving average and the standard deviation of the prices from the past days.
